# Weeds

I love Google Calendar. I use it all the time to plan my life to the minute across multiple calendars. Unfortunately, in the existing Google Calendar UI means that when I am adding new events to my calendar (which I do a lot), I have to perform 3 extra mouse clicks to make sure the event goes in the right calendar. This was unacceptable.

With Weeds, I can suffix my calendar event title with a hashtag to assign it to a particular calendar. This is similar to how you can assign tasks to projects in Todoist's Quick Add feature.

## Name

Oh, you weren't expected a project named Weeds to be a Google Calendar automation utility? I guess that's fair. The name Weeds comes from the fact that I use a ***hash***tag to quickly add events to my ***cal***ender.

I would strongly recommend that you do not look at the source because it is one of the hackiest things I have ever written. It can break any second.
